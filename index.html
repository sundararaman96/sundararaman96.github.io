            <h3>Python and R</h3>
            
            <p>Love to analyse datasets and predict results for the future. Python and R are my base for analysing the datasets. I worked in python for more than a year which gives me better understanding of datasets. 
              Before visualising or training the datasets our first step is data cleansing for getting a better outcome.</p>
